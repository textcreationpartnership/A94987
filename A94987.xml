            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Cities New POET'S
MOCK-SHOVV.</head>
            <l>HEarken good people in Countrey and City,</l>
            <l>For I do intend to be very witty,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Londons</hi> Lord Mayor ſhall be my Ditty.</l>
            <l>Of the <hi>Skinners-Hall</hi> was this man of might,</l>
            <l>He walketh by day, and ſleepeth by night,</l>
            <l>And with his fine Sword the Bakers doth fright.</l>
            <l>Scarce had the ruddy morning broke,</l>
            <l>When my Lord Mayor out of his dream awoke,</l>
            <l>Quoth he, hath <hi>Will</hi> to the Barber ſpoke?</l>
            <l>His voice made his wife her eyes to unlock,</l>
            <l>Quoth ſhe, where is <hi>Mary</hi> to bring me my Smock?</l>
            <l>With that my Lord Mayor with his Slippers did knock.</l>
            <l>When he was ſhaved, and all things were fit,</l>
            <l>He ſent for a pound of Beef from the Spit,</l>
            <l>And haſtily eat it up every bit.</l>
            <l>Then away went he to his <hi>Galley-foiſt,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>He rode on a horſe, 'cauſe the weather was moiſt,</l>
            <l>At which the women and children rejoyc't.</l>
            <l>Who all in <hi>Scullers</hi> did go ſtraightway,</l>
            <l>For to behold a moſt gallant Fray,</l>
            <l>Which <hi>Criple gate</hi> men performed that day.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Criple gate</hi> men did notable Feats,</l>
            <l>The Engliſh man the Spaniard beats,</l>
            <l>And all the way merrily piped the VVaights.</l>
            <l>The Drums did ratle, the Guns did thunder,</l>
            <l>The people did laugh, and the people did wonder,</l>
            <l>And all the poor Fiſh lay trembling under.</l>
            <l>Then landed the Mayor and his Aldermen old,</l>
            <l>VVith Scarlet Gowns, and Chains of Gold,</l>
            <l>Yet none of them could a Dream unfold.</l>
            <l>Before and behinde were the <hi>Dung-boats</hi> all dreſt,</l>
            <l>VVith Flags and Pendants of the very beſt,</l>
            <l>And in them ſate the VViſe men of the Eaſt.</l>
            <l>To VVeſtward they went both <hi>Jack</hi> and <hi>Tony,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To ſhew the Protector they had yet more mony,</l>
            <l>For which he thanked them from a <hi>Bellcony.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Now comes the Mayor to the Bar of Courſe,</l>
            <l>To the Judge he made legs like <hi>Banks</hi>'s horſe,</l>
            <l>He could do no better, 'twas well 'twas no worſe.</l>
            <l>Then ſpake the <hi>Recorder,</hi> wiſe man he,</l>
            <l>At length, my Lord Baron, are come we,</l>
            <l>Your Honors VVo<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſhip for to ſee.</l>
            <l>But that the people did throng ſo faſt,</l>
            <l>Indeed, my Lord, we had made more haſte,</l>
            <l>But who can remedy what is paſt.</l>
            <l>Therefore to avoid this miſchief hereafter,</l>
            <l>Pray let our <hi>Green-men</hi> come with us by water,</l>
            <l>They'l open the Croud, and make you much laughter.</l>
            <l>And now Mr. Baron, if I be not too bold,</l>
            <l>I think here's a Mayor worth his weight in Gold,</l>
            <l>Pray ſwear him quickly, for 't is very cold.</l>
            <l>Then anſwer'd the Baron 'oth' Exchequer, and ſaid,</l>
            <l>My Lord, to ſee you in truth I am glad,</l>
            <l>You ſeem a Gentleman proper and ſtaid.</l>
            <l>Then he went on not at all fluſter'd,</l>
            <l>God bleſs your Lordſhip and your Cuſtard,</l>
            <l>And may your Juſtice ſting like Muſtard.</l>
            <l>But now he's come to the City again,</l>
            <l>And home to Dinner he muſt amain,</l>
            <l>VVith Capon-broth to waſh his New Chain.</l>
            <l>Againſt the <hi>Old Change</hi> a Pag'ant did meet him,</l>
            <l>And there a Gyant alſo did greet him,</l>
            <l>There was no houſe in <hi>London</hi> could fit him.</l>
            <l>This Gyant he walked upon Stilts,</l>
            <l>VVith his tricks he tickled the peoples milts,</l>
            <l>And he had a Sword with fifteen hilts.</l>
            <l>He th<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>earned the Tower away to bear,</l>
            <l>VVith all the New Silver that was there,</l>
            <l>But, quoth the Lord Mayor, Sir, do if you dare.</l>
            <l>VVith that he fell down, to ſet forth Ambition,</l>
            <l>For no man is ſafe in Fortunes tuition,</l>
            <l>Therefore good people walk in ſubmiſſion.</l>
            <l>I'th Pageant there were Leopards two,</l>
            <l>In them ſate two Moors as black as a ſhooe;</l>
            <l>Now gueſs if the people had nothing to do:</l>
            <l>At every corner a Virgin ſat,</l>
            <l>They lookt each one as ſad as a Cat;</l>
            <l>For they did mourn for I know not what.</l>
            <l>Before there ſate an old man in black,</l>
            <l>He ſeem'd as if he ſomething did lack,</l>
            <l>Sure he wanted a Cup of my Lord Mayors Sack.</l>
            <l>But when he did ſee my Lord Mayor come,</l>
            <l>He threw off his Cloak, and ſcratched his Bum,</l>
            <l>And out of his throat his flegm did hum.</l>
            <l>Quoth he, my Lord, and one 'oth' four and twenty,</l>
            <l>To tell you the truth my belly is empty,</l>
            <l>To ſtay ſo long at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> what meant ye?</l>
            <l>Swearing and chaffing, then came the Cook,</l>
            <l>Quoth he, what a ſtir's here to ſwear on a Book?</l>
            <l>I thought his wits would have his brains forſook</l>
            <l>My Lord convinced by Logick ſo ſtrong,</l>
            <l>His <hi>Green-men</hi> cauſed to open the throng,</l>
            <l>That he the more quickly might paſs along:</l>
            <l>But as if the devil did ow him a ſpight,</l>
            <l>And reſolved to keep him from victuals till night,</l>
            <l>At Soaper-lane end behold another ſight.</l>
            <l>The Pageant it was a very fine Toy,</l>
            <l>'T was invented ſure by ſome <hi>Pauls-ſchool</hi> boy,</l>
            <l>It made my Lord Mayors heart leap for joy.</l>
            <l>Firſt <hi>Pan</hi> with his Horns himſelf deſcries,</l>
            <l>Next him ſate <hi>Orpheus</hi> on a Seat that did riſe,</l>
            <l>Behind ſate four Satyrs with hairy thighs.</l>
            <l>Wilde beaſts there was of many a ſort,</l>
            <l>Moſt lively done, thank <hi>Iermin</hi> for't,</l>
            <l>But heaven be prais'd they did no body hurt</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Pan</hi> did ſet forth a Cuckoldly Clown,</l>
            <l>Of which there are many in <hi>London</hi> town,</l>
            <l>Would I had as many pounds of my own.</l>
            <l>There Prentices were ſet forth by the Satyrs,</l>
            <l>Who often do prove themſelves no women-haters,</l>
            <l>When they run away with their Maſters Daughters.</l>
            <l>This made my Lord Mayor earneſtly gaze,</l>
            <l>Alas his Lordſhip was in an amaze,</l>
            <l>When up ſtept <hi>Orpheus,</hi> and ſpake in this phraſe:</l>
            <l>Quoth he man of might, that rul'ſt with a Mace</l>
            <l>For which the Taylor did make a green Caſe,</l>
            <l>Welcom the Comfort of thy new ſhaven face.</l>
            <l>At Soaper-lane end ſtand Watchmen mighty,</l>
            <l>Which maketh us in this place to greet ye,</l>
            <l>Who are the chief Watchmen of our City</l>
            <l>For I know no man, as I am a Sinner,</l>
            <l>Fitter then you who are a Skinner,</l>
            <l>To be our Cities <hi>Wakefield Pinner;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>For eaſieſt are by you to be ſeen,</l>
            <l>The Knaves that would get our walls within,</l>
            <l>Cloth'd in the Lambs and Foxes skin:</l>
            <l>Beſides the City is a great Bear,</l>
            <l>And wickedneſs like a skin doth wear,</l>
            <l>I pray you flea it off, good my Lord Mayor.</l>
            <l>Let Juſtice alſo that mighty Vertue,</l>
            <l>Before you go like <hi>Green men</hi> that ſport you,</l>
            <l>With Fire in her mouth, that Vice may not hurt you,</l>
            <l>More would he have ſaid, but the Cook in haſt,</l>
            <l>Sent one to ask Mayor why time he did waſte,</l>
            <l>To hear a fool prate in a Pageant plac't?</l>
            <l>With that to this home moſt nimbly he traces,</l>
            <l>Where Criple-gate men ſtood in their due places,</l>
            <l>With Muskets cock't and <hi>Leopard</hi> faces.</l>
            <l>The Mayor in his Houſe, they did not refuſe</l>
            <l>To give him many Peals to give 'em their dues,</l>
            <l>They valu'd their Powder as the dirt of their ſhooes.</l>
            <l>Thus was my Lord Mayor of his Chain of State ſeiz'd,</l>
